We’ve just launched a site for a new business in Tunbridge Wells: [Oak & Interiors](https://oandi.co.uk/). It’s a nice & simple, shop window site that showcases the sorts of products they stock, without going down the full Ecommerce route.

I built it in WordPress using the brilliant [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/). Although not the most functionally challenging build, there were opportunities for some nice micro-interaction animations, schema markup, Instagram integration and a fancy mobile menu. Plus there’s a supremely compact domain name, which is always a win in my book.
