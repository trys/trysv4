On days where the weather has been sub-optimal for venturing outdoors, I've spent my lunch breaks making some tweaks to my website. Nothing spectacular, but it feels great to tinker, optimise, and be a bit creative.

I've added an [about](/about/) page, and might well follow up with a couple of other [slash pages](https://slashpages.net/). Although I agree with [Chris'](https://chriscoyier.net) sentiment that [most slash pages could be great blog posts](https://chriscoyier.net/2025/01/04/slash-pages/), I also felt it was time for a space to put a career list, and some other bits about me.

On the blog, I've added category navigation to the top of the page. And in the name of improving cross linking, I've added tags/related content to the bottom of the blog posts themselves. I'm looking forward to putting on some good music and spending some mindless time tagging the back catalogue.
