I don't remember a single line of code from [FFConf 2024](https://2024.ffconf.org/).

Perhaps [Mike Hall](https://www.skeptic.org.uk/author/mike-hall/) included a short nod when talking about micro-optimisations in `for` loops, but that was about it. This conference was and is about so much more than code. The talks focused on themes like:

- Finding purpose in our work
- Building and scaling inclusive communities
- Critically thinking about tech and AI
- Handling death online more respectfully
- Self-reflecting and communicating more effectively

It was the annual community gathering for like-minded, web-loving people. It was a space to reflect on our industry and ourselves. It was an opportunity to catch up with online friends and make new ones. It was a [balm for the soul](https://adactio.com/journal/21549).

I don't remember a single line of code from FFConfâ€”and that's a feature, not a bug.

Here are a few snaps:
