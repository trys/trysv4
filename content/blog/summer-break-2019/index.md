### Kayaking

The first holiday activity was kayaking, a 'sport' I have not partaken in for many a year. It was tremendous fun, and I might've got the bug. I even went river swimming, wore a silly boy racer hat and then stupidly played squash afterwards. Photos taken by Alex - thanks!

### Cake

I quite enjoy a good bake. I don't have many culinary skills, but I'm not too bad at cakes, providing they are a variation on the classic Victoria sponge. I made a Passion Fruit and Orange cake for my sister's birthday, and it went down rather well.

### London

After a ridiculously early alarm call, Lauren and I went up to London. We parted ways at Elephant & Castle and I wandered through the city over to [Daisie](https://www.daisie.com/). It was great to head back and see the team - the last four months have flown by since leaving them.

I then met up with Tim (check out his snazzy [new website)](https://novis.co) for lunch at St. Pauls. Following that, I wandered over to the Tate Modern for an afternoon of art - not something I usally do. It was really great - [Naoya Hatakeyama's series](<(https://www.tate.org.uk/tate-etc/issue-46-summer-2019/naoya-hatakeyama-maquettes-light-everything-illuminated)>) on the urban night lights of Tokyo was a particular highlight. I took a number of photographs on my phone, aiming to capture silhouettes in the museum and city.

### Walking

City life does very little for me, I much prefer to be out in the silence of the sticks. I took the opportunity to go for a number of walks; sometimes several a day, just to get out and clear my head. The weather was pretty stunning all week, so most evenings would see a walk down the fields behind the village. It was lush.

### Sheffield Park and cooking

Thursday was a chilled day of reading, walking, film watching and burger making. Solid.

### Goodwood

It's been [several months](https://photography.trysmudford.com/gallery/goodwood-77th-members-meeting/) since I went down to Goodwood. There was a Mustang track day, but to be honest it could've been anything. It was just nice to potter around, eat breakfast, look at some planes and cars, take a few snaps and head home!

### Sheffield Park (again)

For the third time in the week, I went to Sheffield Park! National Trust's are such good value on a young person's ticket. My sister got a tripod for her birthday, so we went out to try it out. It's been a while since I've taken a tripod on a walk, so I grabbed an ND filter and did some long exposures by the lake.

### Running

I attended my second Parkrun, narrowly beating my PB. I reckon I set off too fast and paid the price near the end, but I made it! The day ended with another wander round the village.

### Stoolball

Lauren was playing in the Sussex Stoolball tournament on Sunday, so I headed down to Seaford again to cheer them on! It was lots of fun!
