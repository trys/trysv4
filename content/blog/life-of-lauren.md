Now I know we're meant to rest and put down our laptops during the holidays, but with a kitchen renovation, work business and the ol' pandemic, this Christmas break was the first time Lauren and I had the time and headspace to get a little creative project off the ground.

Presenting: [Life of Lauren](https://www.lifeoflauren.co.uk), a personal site for my fantastic wife! We designed it together and got it finished today. Like many personal sites (this one included), it's a place to write, share and be creative; her own little corner of the internet. I can't wait to see what she does with it!
