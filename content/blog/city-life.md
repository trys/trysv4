As my final days at daisie draw to a close, I've been reflecting the lessons I've learned, the people I've met, and the opinions I've encountered.

Prior to joining the startup, I earned my spurs at Tomango, a creative agency in Sussex, and when I say in Sussex, I mean in the middle-of-a-field Sussex. It was an iddylic location, about as far from a city as you could get. There were no ammenities, no shops, no fancy coffee joints and certainly no Deliveroo.

I anticipated, and looked forward to the inevitable culture shock of coming to the ciy after 6 sheltered years in the field. But I, in hindsight naÃ¯vely, didn't expect some of the different approaches, values and career paths that the 'city team' had. It's been eye-opening and very interesting hearing their stories, weighing them and learning from them.

The other day, Jake Archibald posted a fascinating comparison of [F1 team's web performance](https://jakearchibald.com/2019/f1-perf/), two subjects very dear to my heart. But it was the final thoughts that struck me:

> None of the teams used any of the big modern frameworks. They're mostly Wordpress & Drupal, with a lot of jQuery. It makes me feel like I've been in a bubble in terms of the technologies that make up the bulk of the web.

oooph. Nail on the head.

It reminded my of an encounter in my first week or so at daisie. I was chatting to one of the team about my previous role. _I built two websites a month in WordPress_.

They laughed... _WordPress! Who uses that anymore?!_

[Nearly a third of the web](https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/05/wordpress-now-powers-30-of-websites/) as it turns out.

I may be jumping to conclusions from a dataset of two points, but I feel like the web built in the city, is very different to web outside. Or perhaps, the web built in 'city-sized' companies is different to 'village-sized companies'. The [Wealthy Western Web](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/world-wide-web-not-wealthy-western-web-part-1/) is very much alive in Shoreditch.

## JavaScript, JavaScript everywhere

This won't come as a shock to most readers, but ~~web~~ javascript developers rather like their tooling. And in many or most ways, it's a great thing. Tools can give us confidence in what we're building and deploying. They can speed up development, and help us prototype efficiently.

But they're also an abstraction, another hurdle to entry and can be hugely problematic when things go pear-shaped. They are a crutch, and when they fall away, it's interesting to see who's left standing.

## Sweating the details

The tooling fascination also ties-in to a broad-brush development style I've noticed. Many of the team have come from huge companies, we're talking thousands of developers & designers. They've either worked on products so vast that a full system understanding is nigh on impossible, or in teams so large that your prescribed focus is very narrow. There's no room for the big picture, big picture is someone else's job.
