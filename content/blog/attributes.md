It's fascinating how quickly Jacob picks up new words and concepts. He could easily identify these as 'cups', but then we went and confused things by adding attributes to the mix. It's amazing to watch his brain re-map an item from a 'cup', to a 'red cup', to a 'red cup with a dog on it', to 'a red cup with a dog on it, that's number one in the stack of six'. He stumbles, of course, but so quickly his malleable sponge brain just accepts the colours, numbers and other attributes.

Anyway, I just remembered that `shape-outside` existed and thought I'd write something to use it.
