Google have released [Poly](https://poly.google.com/), a home for 3D objects ready to be included in your VR/AR project. Combined with [Aframe](https://aframe.io/), these models can be included into a WebVR site. For a developer (who dabbles in design), this is a great resource to get a prototype working quickly.

And some of the [3D models](https://poly.google.com/view/dLHpzNdygsg) are pretty epic.
