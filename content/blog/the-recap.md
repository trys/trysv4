**Task:** TODO List  

## 5. JS - AJAX

## Today's task(s)

I've created a bunch of small and smallish tasks to run through. Refer back to the previous session notes, there's nothing we haven't covered before. The tasks are in the training repository under: `/2018-01-24/index.html`. If you load up that file in Sublime/Chrome and check out the script tag.
