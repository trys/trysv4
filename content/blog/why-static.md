I’ve been really interested in static site generation, JAMstack, Hugo and Netlify for a while now. In fact, my previous website was Jekyll site hosted on GitHub pages.

At Tomango, I’ve just built our first production site using these technologies and needed a resource to pool together all the benefits of SSG for a meeting this week. A meta solution seemed to fit the bill.

[Why Static?](https://why-static.netlify.com/) is a static site in Hugo that (at the time of writing) lists out a lot of benefits to SSG and Netlify. At this point, it’ll form a checklist of things to mention when explaining the concept to others on the team.
