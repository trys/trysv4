Tomorrow I leave for Brussels. I’m attending a three-day workshop run by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js.

I can’t wait to get stuck in to the nitty-gritty of an exciting JS framework. Learning by reading docs, playing around in a test area, or even building a side-project is one thing, focusing solely on one task for three days with the person who made the project, is quite another. I’m looking forward to the programatical challenges that lie ahead.

I’m also (sort of, maybe, almost) looking forward to the challenge of going to a new city. This is my first trip abroad on my own so it’s a pretty big deal. There won’t be much time for sightseeing as the company running the training has a great itinerary in store so the amount of time for getting lost in Brussels will; thankfully, be minimal. It’s crazy that it’ll take almost as much time to get from my sleepy little village in East Sussex to London as it will to get from London to Brussels.

So as long as Southern Rail doesn’t let me down, I’ll be in Brussels this time tomorrow!
