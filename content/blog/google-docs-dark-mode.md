It's end of year review time, so instead of actually writing, I spent a few minutes configuring Google Docs to work in a pseudo-dark mode.

1. Open a new [Google Doc](https://docs.new)
2. Click on "File â†’ Page setup"
3. Choose the "Pageless" option, and set the background colour to black/dark grey, the "OK"

4. Change the text colour to white (you might want to set this as a theme if you're going all-in on this)
5. Make your window "fullscreen" (the green button on the top left of a window on Mac)
6. Click the little "^" icon on the right of the task bar (by the "Editing" select)

7. Pinch zoom in a hair, and...

voila. Now to write this review...
