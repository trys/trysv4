Inspired by a visit to Bletchley Park, I decided to create a JavaScript implementation of the infamous Enigma machine used by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. It models the three rotors (with turnover), reflector and lamp board providing the same encryption level as the 1928 Enigma G model.

Currently it lacks the plugboard but I hope to add this shortly bringing the machine up to a 1939 naval-spec Enigma.
