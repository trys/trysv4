I’ve just launched [Eulerplate](http://www.eulerplate.co.uk/), a repository of my [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) progress.

## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a set of mathematical and programming challenges. Using your chosen programming language, the aim is to write a small program that will solve the problem in under a minute. Some of these problems are pretty complex and refactoring your code to run efficiently is very important.

## What is Eulerplate?

By documenting my progress through the problems, I’m hoping to see improvement in both my mathematics and programming skills. I may well refactor my solutions in the future, equally, I’m hoping to tackle the problems in a variety of languages over time. Currently there are a number in PHP and the majority in JavaScript.

As the problems are reasonably bite-sized, I’m hoping to tackle a few a month but that may pick up at points, they can be rather addictive once you get into them.
