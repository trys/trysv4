- Typescript
- GraphQL
- Classes _shakes fist at immutability_
- Clear public API
- Testable
- Use sugar and conventions
- Component library _should_ include documentation, as well as being a visual reference
- Not there to reduce creativity
- WordPress hooks
- Additive changes
- Musts, shoulds, coulds
- State machines, always be a reflection of state
- Data wrangling colocation
