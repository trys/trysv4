I was going to write a bit of a 2024 recap, but quite frankly, don't have the energy to do so. It's been a tricky <del>Christmas break</del> year full of illness and stress and finding the headspace and time to pen anything feels impossible right now.

There have been some tremendous highs in amongst the lows, both personally, familially, and in my career; two wonderful holidays with Lauren & Jacob, delivering a [meetup talk](/blog/css-cafe) at long last, launching some exciting [Utopia tools](https://utopia.fyi), watching Jacob take his first steps and say his first words (then pretty much not stopping talking!), being nominated and winning a Motorway award, organising a carol concert, and working with some incredibly smart folk at Motorway.

I'm so grateful for my friends, colleagues, and most importantly, family who've helped support us through the hospital trips, the sleepless nights, and the exhaustion. 2025 will be a year for saying 'no' more, and prioritising our family's health and wellbeing over everything else. That's the plan, anyway.

So long 2024 - it's been a ride.
