4.5 years between weeknotes? Whoops! I won't recap the gap, fear not.

I turned 31 on Friday, so the weekend was spent celebrating with family. The birth<em>day</em> itself was pretty nondescript; I was recovering from a flu-ey virus thing that sent my temperature through the roof, so a quiet weekend of leisurely strolls was perfect.

Jacob has started taking his first solo steps, which is exciting and scary in equal measure. For someone so short, he looks a long way from the ground when he walks.

Work has been an interesting mix of divergence and convergence. We're deploying tactical fixes whilst big picture thinking about the next quarter. [Our project](https://buy.motorway.co.uk/) has taken a trip round the [Hero's journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) and it's time to strap on our brave boots and venture off into the unknown again.

Wednesday provided yet another change of pace where I donned my latest [Utopia t-shirt](https://utopiafyi.teemill.com/) and spent the day locked in a boardroom discussing how we're going to bring some fluid goodness to our internal design system. Again, it was a combination of nitty-gritty details where we prototyped different base units in Figma & code, alongside broad discussions around semantic spaces and how to encourage adoption. I left with a full heart and an empty head.

In side project news, I migrated both Utopia Figma plugins over to a plugin schema and [blogged about it](/blog/async-figma/). I also posted about [reverse engineering](/blog/reverse-engineers/), a subject I was thinking about when preparing my [last talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd6wSHqGreQ). I also made some CSS tweaks to my website, widening the content width, tweaking the type scale, and re-writing the home page intro copy.
