# Hey, I'm Trys.

I build for the web at [Motorway](https://motorway.co.uk), sitting at the intersection between [design and engineering](/blog/i-think-im-a-design-engineer/).

My 9-5 involves writing React/Typescript/Next.js, contributing to design systems & advocating for the user. My 5-9 includes growing an open-source [fluid responsive design](https://utopia.fyi) project, [tinkering](/#side-projects) with web API's and [writing](/blog/) on this website. My weekends are spent with my [amazing family](https://instagram.com/trysmudford).
