# Hi there, I'm Trys.

I build for the web at [Motorway](https://motorway.co.uk), sitting at the intersection between [design and engineering](/blog/i-think-im-a-design-engineer/).

My core skills are in semantic HTML & CSS, progressively enhanced JS, PWA's, web performance, Vue.js & React, static site generation and generally putting the user first.
