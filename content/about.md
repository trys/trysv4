Hey! I'm Trys. I'm a design engineer / software engineer living in the UK. I've been working on the web for well over a decade now, and I've been lucky enough to work with some rather lovely people and exciting companies along the way. Here's a little career nostalgia:

Thanks to many years in the agency-world, I've found I thrive in the (sometimes) chaotic space of early stage projects, where I can help shape the product, the technical direction, and the team. I love working with systematic designers and ambitious product owners to create responsive, responsible, and delightful web experiences.

In 2020, I co-created [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi), an approach to fluid responsive design, aiming to provide a common language between design and engineering to improve efficiency and consistency. Utopia now boasts Figma plugins, code generators, NPM modules, and many blog posts outlining this approach to responsive web design. I've been waxing lyrical about it at [meetups](/blog/css-cafe/), on [podcasts](https://podcast.clearleft.com/season01/episode03/), and [online](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/designing-developing-fluid-type-space-scales/) ever since. If you're interested in this kind of thing for your conference, I'd love to chat on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/trysmudford.com) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@trys).

Other fun side projects include: [Journalbook](https://journalbook.co) (a totally private, totally offline personal journal), [Sergey](https://sergey.cool) (a very little static site generator), and a [guitar pedalboard in the browser](https://pedalboard.netlify.app/).

I play [guitar](https://www.youtube.com/user/trysmudford) when I can, sometimes take photos of [cars](https://photography.trysmudford.com/) and [conferences](https://www.flickr.com/photos/remysharp/albums/72177720321895884/), and [write](/blog/) about [design engineering](/blog/i-think-im-a-design-engineer/) on the web. I have a brilliant [wife](https://lifeoflauren.co.uk/) and an incredible son who both rock my world.
