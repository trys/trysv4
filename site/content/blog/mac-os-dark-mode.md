I've been using the commute to add a few [JournalBook](https://journalbook.co.uk) features. Yesterday saw the addition of the prize feature everyone loves but very few need: [**Dark Mode!**](https://twitter.com/trysmudford/status/1082547315146133505) Here's how it was built:

## Getting the CSS in order

First on the task list was preparing the CSS for the changeover. As someone who absolutely loves CSS, I'm a little ashamed by the state of it on this project. It's due a major refactor, but let's not dwell on that too much!

All the colours were hard-coded, and scattered among the CSS file - a consolidation was required. I tend to write `.scss`, but this project is still set up with humble ol' CSS. No matter, it's 2019, we have âœ¨&nbsp;Custom Properties!&nbsp;âœ¨

To start with, I moved all the colours up to a single `:root` declaration and set them up as variables.

```css
:root {
  --bg: #fff;
  --color: #444;
  --line: #ddd;
  --heading: #1e2357;
  /* ... */
}
```

Then I swapped out all references in the remainder of the CSS.

```css
#app {
  background: var(--bg);
  color: var(--color);
}
```

Finally, to create the dark mode style, I copied the `:root` variable rules, and created a 'theme'.

```css
[data-theme='dark'] {
  --bg: #131420;
  --color: #efefef;
  --line: #555;
  --heading: #c5c5c5;
}
```

Thanks to the ðŸ”¥ wonderful cascade ðŸ”¥ (big fan in case you're wondering), these variables are updated for any child elements.

So from a HTML point of view, theme switching is a case of changing **one data attribute** on **one element**. Nice.

## JS theme switching

[JournalBook](https://journalbook.co.uk) is written in Preact, so this code will be a bit ES6'y.

Here's the base App class. We call `getDefaultTheme()` (which I'll stub out in a mo') to set our initial state, then render the app with the aforementioned data attribute.

```jsx
class App extends Component {
  state = {
    theme: getDefaultTheme()
  };

  render(props, { theme }) {
    return (
      <div id="app" data-theme={theme}>
        {/* The rest of the app */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

In `getDefaultTheme()`, we first check to see if the theme has been explicitly set by the user. If so, we return it. Next, we run a `matchMedia` call to see if they've set their OS to have the dark colour scheme. This is part of CSS Media Queries level 5, and can be [read up on here](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#prefers-color-scheme). It's only currently available in Safari tech preview, and on OS Mojave, so admitedly, this part is a niche feature. Finally, we return an empty string, which we'll class as a preference for the default theme.

```js
const getDefaultTheme = () => {
  const userTheme = localStorage.getItem('journalbook_theme');

  if (userTheme !== null) {
    return userTheme;
  }

  if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
    return 'dark';
  }

  return '';
};
```

This all works really nicely! If you've set a theme, you get it. If not, you get the most appropriate theme for your system preferences.

#### Sidenote

This can also be achieved in CSS, with the media query:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /*  */
}
```

But for the JournalBook use case, we need to first check to see if a user has explicitly set their own theme first, hence the JS involvement.

## Live system switching

There is a minor issue with the current code: it doesn't react live to system-level contrast mode changes. _Is that even possible_, I hear you cry! (I asked the very same question till [Jason Miller](https://twitter.com/trysmudford/status/1082720987202928641) came to the rescue).

I had no idea you could use `addListener` on `window.matchMedia`! <small>(another sidenote, my mind is whizzing at the possibilities with this new information).</small>

With that, we can add a listener and respond to system preference changes live in the browser!

```js
componentDidMount() {
  if (localStorage.getItem('journalbook_theme') === null) {
    window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').addListener(({ matches }) => {
      this.setState({ theme: matches ? 'dark' : '' });
    });
  }
}
```

Check out Jason's video of the switch in action!

## Manual switching

The final piece of the puzzle is the manual theme picker. Thanks to our embrace of the cascade and CSS custom properties, it's not too bad to implement.

```jsx
class Settings extends Component {
  state = {
    theme: getDefaultTheme()
  };

  updateTheme = event => {
    const theme = event.target.value;
    localStorage.setItem('journalbook_theme', theme);
    document.querySelector('#app').dataset.theme = theme;
    this.setState({ theme });
  };

  render(props, { theme }) {
    return (
      <form>
        <label for="theme">Theme</label>
        <select id="theme" onChange={this.updateTheme} value={theme}>
          <option value="">Default</option>
          <option value="dark">Dark</option>
        </select>
        {/* The rest of the settings form */}
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

JournalBook doesn't yet have any global state, so we have to manually set the data attribute, which is less than ideal. But I reckon it's fine for what is a single attribute change for live theme switching.

### In closing

I wanted to extend a massive thanks to [Jason](https://twitter.com/_developit/) for demonstrating `matchMedia` listeners so aptly! I can't wait to experiment with them more!
